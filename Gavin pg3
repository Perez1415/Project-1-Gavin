  <h1>NFL History </h1>
  <p>The date was November 12, 1892 a day that would forever be remeber in sports
    history no one involved that day could possibly have recognized
   the importance of the Football. It was the day that the Allegheny Athletic
   Association football team defeated the Pittsburgh Athletic Club. The game in itself was not a memoralbe event. Game was never to be forgotten
    moment in sports history one of the AAA players William Heff to play the game. Thus pro football made its debut more than 100 years ago in comparatively obscure surroundings that could not possibly have provided the slightest clue to the
    world wide popularity the sport would be destined to enjoy in the fun of pro football's first century.
