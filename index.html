  <h1> My Favorite Team </h1>
  <p> Today i am writing about my favorite team in football.
 My favorite team out all of the NFL is the Dallas Cowboys.
  I've been watching football for my whole life i love the sport so much
  i told my parents that i wanted play the sport. I have played footbal for 4 years and still is for the PHS Jv team.
  I like the Cowboys so much because alot of my family does and been fans for a long time but some like others teams.
  <p> The Cowboys have some really greats this year and some great players. Every i hope we can
    make it to the playoffs and win the superbowl. The Cowboys won 5 superbowls in the NFL lifetime and are closer every year
    to win another.  <a href="http://www.dallascowboys.com/multimedia/videos/game-highlights"> Highlights</a>
